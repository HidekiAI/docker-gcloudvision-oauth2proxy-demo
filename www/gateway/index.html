      Gateway: SHOULD NOT BE HERE

  This is the (nginx-proxy) gateway. You should never land here...

  <li>If you've landed on this page, you've most likely set your
    redirect URL incorrectly.</li>
  <li> This is the "gateway" (via nginx-proxy) page, which should never be seen by the user.
    It's sole purpose is to redirect the user to the correct page
    based on either the origin URI (i.e. myhost.mydomain.tld) with or without port and routing paths used. </li>
  <li>For this excercise, we have two domains: <b>www.mydomain.tld</b> and <b>internal-developers.mydomain.tld</b>
    (with or without ports). The filenames located in <u>vhosts.d</u> directory indicates the origin (i.e.
    "internal-developers.mydomain.tld") and its contents indicates its location routing paths. </li>
  <li>If you've landed on this page, you first want to determine the URI used (i.e. any URI origin that is not
    <b>www</b> or <b>internal-developers</b>
    or possibly misspelled origin such as "www.my-domain-with-dash.tld") and just
    find that string in your source code</li>
